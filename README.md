## Supporting Evidence-Based Decision-Making for Pipeline Safety

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of an interactive data visualization platform dedicated to oil pipeline accidents and their aftereffects. The platform aims to empower stakeholders with actionable insights for evidence-based decision-making, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of pipeline safety.

## Task List
The platform addresses critical questions through interactive visualizations:

1. Pipeline Operators Analysis

Identify operators with the highest number of pipeline accidents.

2. Accident Trends Over Time
Explore the historical trend of accidents and observe recent changes.

3. Correlation Analysis
Investigate correlations between pipeline types, operators, and accident causes.
Assess the impact of spills on property, commodities, and the environment.
Propose preventive measures to mitigate future incidents and reduce associated costs.

4. Spatial Analysis
Identify patterns or trends in the locations of pipeline accidents.

5. Pipeline Type and Cause Correlation
Investigate correlations between pipeline types and causes of accidents.

6. Liquid Spills Analysis
Determine the most spilled liquid and its occurrence locations.

7. Economic Impact by State
Analyze the state-wise economic impact of pipeline accidents.

8. Leak Trends and Causes
Observe the overall trend in pipeline leaks and identify causes for preventive measures.

9. Common Causes Analysis
Identify the most common causes of pipeline accidents.

10. Frequency Trends
Analyze how the frequency of pipeline accidents has changed over the years.

## Visual Encodings
1. Color Gradient
Utilizes d3.interpolateGreens for positive values (e.g., indicating safety measures).
Utilizes d3.interpolateReds for negative values (e.g., indicating accidents or spills).

2. Filters
Enable data filtering based on year, region, and other parameters for focused analysis.

3. Features
Brushing for interactive selection.
Value-based sorting for better comparison.
Tooltips for detailed descriptions.
Textual analysis for supplementary context.
Smooth navigation and interactions for an intuitive user experience.
